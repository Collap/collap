TOP Priority: Try to separate frontend (bryg, JSON) and backend (models).



Example module:
	Add a pack that slightly changes one of the templates.

- Copy default config files to tomcat/collap/config if this folder has not been created yet.
- "Of course, there's no way to test http or https in the template". Make that happen.
- The build scripts are twice or triple.
- This createTransientEntity stuff sucks.
- Use @Nullable where needed!
- Markdown Editor:
  - Custom tags (addable by every plugin) like <wow:ShouldersOfWhatever>
  - The editor should have a plain text editing field and a preview, but also buttons to add custom tags.
- Core:
  - General permission management and access restriction on a per-controller base (Possibly with annotations?)
  - Add an ownPath variable to bryg that points to the current controller path!
- Post:
  - Make it possible to create posts with cached content read from an unmanaged file.
  - Add head/meta support for posts!
  - Does the type have to be changeable?
  - The names of the std plugins differ from the archive name.

Global Redirection!



Potentially: Use JRuby for code reuse!



A test plugin type!



Bug: Plain type data is not always deleted!



1. Implement post type for decks, raids, etc.
2. Put the @@@ tags into DB (syntax: <hs:id>)! Also: How can the tags be used in jade/bryg (Probably with some extra processor)?
